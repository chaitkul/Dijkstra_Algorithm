# Dijkstra_Algorithm
Implementation of the dijkstra algorithm to find the optimal path for a point robot in a given environment

Libraries Used:
	import numpy as np
	import heapq
	import cv2
	
Steps to run the code:
1. Run the program.
2. User will be prompted for x and y coordinates for start and goal nodes respectively.
3. If any of the coordinates is in obstacle space or beyond the scope of the map, an error message will be printed and user will be asked to provide valid input.
4. After entering valid inputs, code will be executed and the visualization of the map will be shown with explored nodes and the shortest path.
5. The path from the start node to goal node and the distance travelled by the point robot will be displayed in the terminal.
